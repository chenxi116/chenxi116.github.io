title:  "Deep Learning Seminar"
---
I took a seminar course on deep learning in the spring quarter, instructed by [Prof. Fei Sha][feisha]. I think the reading list in the [syllabus][syllabus] is quite good and helpful, so I decide to blog about it. 

As part of course requirement, I wrote three 5-page summaries of the corresponding topic (depth, regularization, optimization) in deep learning, which roughly follow the papers listed in the course syllabus. Hope you find them useful. Should be a quick and easy read ;)
